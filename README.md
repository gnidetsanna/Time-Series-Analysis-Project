# Time Series Analysis Project

This project is a part of my Machine Learning course, focused on time series analysis. The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis, model time series data, and predict future values using various techniques.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the main analysis.
- `data/`: Directory for any datasets (if they are public or generated).
- `results/`: Contains the results or output files, if necessary.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Dataset name or link]
- **Description**: Briefly describe the data, such as the frequency of the time series, the type of data (e.g., sales, weather, stocks), and any pre-processing steps.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding trends, seasonality, and any patterns in the data.
3. **Modeling**: Applying time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Forecasting**: Predicting future data points.

## Results

- Brief summary of key findings and visualizations.

## Usage

To run this project, youâ€™ll need the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
