# Time Series Analysis Project

This project is a part of my Machine Learning course, focused on analyzing time series data and building predictive models. 
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights from the data, understand underlying patterns, and predict future values 
using various time series analysis techniques.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: [Provide dataset source or description]
- **Data Type**: Time series data capturing [brief description of data such as sales, weather metrics, or any specifics].
- **Objective**: Perform exploratory data analysis, apply time series models, and forecast future values.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns.
3. **Modeling**: Implementing time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.) to capture patterns in the data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance with relevant metrics.
5. **Forecasting**: Predicting future values based on the models.

## Key Visualizations

### Trend Analysis
![Trend Analysis]({fig1_path})

This graph visualizes the overall trend in the data, highlighting long-term increases or decreases.

### Seasonality Analysis
![Seasonality Analysis]({fig2_path})

This plot shows the seasonal patterns identified in the dataset, illustrating recurring patterns over a fixed interval.

### Model Forecast
![Model Forecast]({fig3_path})

This forecast shows predicted future values based on the selected time series model, illustrating its performance and accuracy.

---

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully analyzed the time series data and built predictive models to forecast future values. 
The results indicate that [briefly summarize any interesting findings or conclusions]. This analysis demonstrates 
proficiency in handling time series data, modeling, and evaluating predictions.
